BFS Path Visualizer
This project is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) path visualizer built using the Pygame library. The visualizer helps users understand the BFS algorithm by providing a graphical representation of how the algorithm explores nodes in a grid to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal.

Features
Interactive grid where users can set start, goal, and barrier nodes
Real-time visualization of the BFS algorithm
Ability to reset the grid and visualize again
Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. Follow the steps below to get started:

Clone the repository:

git clone (git URL)
cd bfs-path-visualizer
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install pygame
Usage
Run the main script to start the visualizer:

python (main script name).py
